# Fellowship Program
The Fellowship program is developed for early career researchers - graduate students, post-docs, research scientists, and early career faculty - to provide exposure, support, and training to explore open science practices and tools. 

Not exactly sure what open science means? We use open science as an umbrella term that encompasses many movements to increase the openness and accessibility of research processes, inputs, and outputs. It includes:
- open access to publications
- open research data
- open source software
- open collaboration
- open peer review
- open notebooks
- open educational resources
- open monographs
- citizen science
- research crowdfunding

Check out the [FOSTER EU](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) [taxonomy](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/resources) and the article by Benedikt Fecher & Sascha Friesike [One Term, Five Schools of Thought](http://book.openingscience.org.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/basics_background/open_science_one_term_five_schools_of_thought.html).

## About the Program
The program will provide a cohort of Fellows with training and hands-on experience with some of the most popular and useful tools available. In addition to formal training opportunities through The Carpentries and guest speakers, we have designated time to explore tools and strategies that are applicable to your field of research. The program directors will guide you in navigating the wealth of resources and research support available across the IU system.

Some of the topics we will explore include:
- Study pre-registration & clinical trial registration
- Mechanisms of open access
- Data sharing, reuse, licensing for secondary analysis
- Open peer review
- Open source tools such as R, Git & Github/Gitlab
- Open notebooks
- Reproducibility, replicability, repeatability
- Open software & software citation

## Why apply?
Beyond the learning opportunities and workshops, the program will provide opportunities to:
- explore new practices to improve your research processes and workflows 
- connect with colleagues and potential mentors across the IUPUI campus to build your support network
- tap into the wealth of resources available on the IUPUI campus and across the IU system
- talk about and share your research with a wide audience
- compete for 3 prizes to support your research
