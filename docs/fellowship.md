# Fellowship Program
The Fellowship program is developed for early career researchers - graduate students, post-docs, research scientists, and early career faculty - to provide exposure, support, and training to explore open research practices and tools. Although the term open science is more common, many of the practices associated with open science are relevant to all disciplines. This program is inclusive of all disciplines and research methods.

Not exactly sure what open research means? We use open research as an umbrella term that encompasses many movements to increase the openness and accessibility of research processes, inputs, and outputs. It includes:
- open access to publications
- open research data
- open source software
- open collaboration
- open peer review
- open notebooks
- open educational resources
- open monographs
- citizen science
- research crowdfunding

## About the Program
The program will provide a cohort of Fellows with training and hands-on experience with some of the most popular and useful tools available. In addition to formal training opportunities through The Carpentries and guest speakers, we have designated time to explore tools and strategies that are applicable to your field of research. The program directors will guide you in navigating the wealth of resources and research support available across the IU system.

Some of the topics we will explore include:
- Study pre-registration & clinical trial registration
- Mechanisms of open access
- Data sharing, reuse, licensing for secondary analysis
- Open peer review
- Open source tools such as R, Git & Github/Gitlab
- Open notebooks
- Reproducibility, replicability, repeatability
- Open software & software citation

## Program Schedule
September 2018 - March 2019

We will meet in-person on a monthly basis, with additional working sessions and informal meetups scheduled as needed for support of the Fellows.

*Session 1 - The Big Picture* 
Weâ€™ll start by exploring some of the ways that researchers are practicing open research and solving big problems. You will begin to learn some core tools that support open research practices and identify open champions in your field.

*Session 2 - Planning to be Open* 
As we move into planning a research project, you will gain more experience using Git/Github and other tools that help you make your research more open, portable, and efficient.

*Session 3 - Collecting & Storing Data* 
Getting good data is vital for producing findings that are validated, reproducible/replicable, and can be shared in appropriate ways. We will explore how plans for dissemination and sharing shape data collection and management.

*Session 4 - Organizing & Describing* 
The principles of organization and description are essential to managing a research project as well as ensuring reproducibility and replicability. Learn some techniques to document and describe research data and files to help improve overall project management.

*Session 5 - Analyzing & Reporting* 
Revisit tools from workshops held earlier in the program (on Git/Github and R/RStats/RStudio) and learn more about characteristics of analysis tools and reporting methods that contribute to research transparency in your discipline(s).

*Session 6 - Sharing & Disseminating* 
Discover how efforts to incorporate open research practices throughout your research projects pays off in the sharing and dissemination of your research! Explore how can you utilize existing open access and data publishing models to boost the visibility of your research and build your reputation.

## Expectations
If accepted into the program, you will be asked to sign a Memorandum of Understanding acknowledging that you will fulfill these expectations to the best of your ability.
  * I will participate fully in the program, attending the monthly meetings and scheduled workshops, to the best of my ability.
  * I will integrate one new tool into my research process during the course of the project. 
  * I agree to talk to other researchers at IUPUI about my experiences with open research tools and practices.
  * I agree to write an essay reflecting on my experience in the program.
