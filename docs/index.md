## Next Generation Researcher Program @ IUPUI

This program was developed for early career researchers in any discipline or field at IUPUI. This includes early career faculty, research scientists, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students. It includes both the Resource Fair and the Fellowship Program.

## Resource Fair

To kick things off, the [IUSM Ruth Lilly Medical Library](https://mednet.medicine.iu.edu/medical-library/) and [IUPUI University Library](https://ulib.iupui.edu/) are co-sponsoring a resource fair on **March 27, 2018 from 11-2pm in the IUPUI Campus Center 450B.**

Units and groups across IUPUI will be there to talk about the services they offer that are specific to early career researchers as well as the opportunities at IUSM and IUPUI for professional and research development. 

Tight schedule that day and no time for lunch? Never fear - there will be snacks and plenty of coffee/tea on hand!

## Fellowship Program
The Fellowship program is developed for early career researchers - graduate students, post-docs, research scientists, and early career faculty - to provide exposure, support, and training to explore open science practices and tools. Fellows will benefit from training, support, and hands-on experience with some of the most popular and useful tools available. In addition to formal training opportunities through The Carpentries and guest speakers, we have designated time to explore tools and strategies that are applicable to your field of research. The program directors will guide you in navigating the wealth of resources and research support available across the IU system.

Fellows will be selected based their application and potential benefit from the program curriculum and expertise available. In pursuit of a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment, the program will adopt the principles outlined in the [OpenCon Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report](https://sparcopen.github.io/opencon-dei-report/). All qualified applicants will receive consideration for participation without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, age, disability status, or protected veteran status. Individuals who require a reasonable accommodation in order to participate in the application process and program are encouraged to contact us for support.
