# Next Generation Researcher Program @ IUPUI

This program was developed for early career researchers in any discipline or field at IUPUI. This includes early career faculty, research scientists, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students. The program includes both the Resource Fair and the Fellowship Program.

## Resource Fair

To kick off this program, the [IUSM Ruth Lilly Medical Library] (https://mednet.medicine.iu.edu/medical-library/) and [IUPUI University Library] (https://ulib.iupui.edu/) are co-sponsoring a **Next Generation Researcher Resource Fair on March 27, 2018 from 11-2pm in the IUPUI Campus Center 450B**.

Weâ€™re inviting units and groups from across IUPUI to exhibit and talk about the services they offer that are specific to early career researchers as well as the opportunities at IUSM and IUPUI for professional and research development. See the [Resource Fair] () page for more information/details.

Last but *not* least, there will be snacks and plenty of coffee/tea on hand :pizza: :cookie: :coffee: :tea:!
